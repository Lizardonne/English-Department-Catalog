# For CS260's Creative Project 1:
For this lab, you will create a basic website using HTML and CSS. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be too similar to the website you built for Lab 1. You must create your own original work.

This is your chance to be creative and build anything you want -- a book store, a social media site, or anything else. You are welcome to provide "fake" data for the website. For example, you can't build a complete clone of Instagram, since you won't have a database, interactive front end, etc. But you could mock up what a clone of Instagram would look like, including pages to show a stream of photos, upload a photo, login to your account, etc.

You are also welcome to use the creative projects throughout the semester to slowly build up a big project. So if you want to build a store, you could start mocking up some of the pages for this project, and then add other parts later. If you build a single website over the course of multiple creative projects, you must add new functionality in each assignment.


This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like.
The basic requirements are:
    A home page
    Three or more additional pages
    The site uses some images
    The site uses Bootstrap for a menu
    A footer that lists the URL for your GitHub repository


We will grade your projects based on:
    You met all the requirements
    How well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:
    90-100: Excellent use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap menu, Bootstrap grid (or CSS grid or flexbox) to make columns, meets requirements, clearly follows web design principles
    80-90: Uses most of the tools, good effort was made, but missed some requirements and/or needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
    70-80: Uses some of the tools, but misses several requirements, and/or does not make a strong effort or follow web design principles
